## üöÄ Overview

**WasteTD** is an all-in-one ESG business solution developed for the Gosoft Hackathon 2025.  
It enables companies to **convert waste** (plastic, metal, etc.) into **cash** and **carbon credits** ‚Äî all in a single platform.  

WasteTD also features **NongGreen**, an intelligent AI agent chatbot that analyzes company documents (PDFs) and web search results to suggest the best monetization strategies.  
The AI leverages the **Jnx03 API** powered by **Jxxn03V2**, a fine-tuned model based on **Typhoon2** architecture.
